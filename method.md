## Methodological Framework

This study employs a descriptive and exploratory econometric approach to examine the relationship between macroeconomic volatility and household credit dynamics.

### Variables
- Dependent Variable: Household credit to private sector (% of GDP)  
- Independent Variables: GDP growth, inflation, interest rate, unemployment  

### Analytical Strategy
- Time-series visualization  
- Descriptive statistical analysis  
- Correlation matrix  
- Volatility estimation using rolling standard deviation  
- OLS regression (planned in Phase 2)  

### Limitations
- Data availability varies across countries and years  
- Causal inference is limited in descriptive phase  
- Structural breaks (crises, pandemics) may bias trend interpretation
