# Macroeconomic Volatility and Household Credit Dynamics

## Abstract
This project investigates the relationship between macroeconomic volatility and household credit expansion in small open and developing economies. Using World Bank and FRED data, the study explores how fluctuations in GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and unemployment influence patterns of private sector credit allocation. The project contributes to debates on financialisation, risk governance, and the political economy of household debt.

## Research Question
How does macroeconomic volatility affect the growth and stability of household credit across emerging and advanced economies?

## Data Sources
- World Bank Open Data (FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS, NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG, FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG, SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS)

## Key Findings (Preliminary)
- Household credit tends to expand during periods of low inflation and stable interest rates  
- Volatility in GDP growth is associated with higher variance in credit allocation  
- Emerging economies show stronger sensitivity to interest rate shifts than advanced economies
